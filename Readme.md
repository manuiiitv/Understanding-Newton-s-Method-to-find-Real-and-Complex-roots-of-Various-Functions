In our exploratory project, we evaluated Newtons method (Newton Raphson Method) for finding out real and complex roots of polynomial functions, and analysed the resulting Newton basins of Attraction. A Newton basin is the set of points (initial guesses) which converges to a particular solution after certain Newton iterations. We took different examples of polynomial functions, calculated their roots (both real and complex) using Newton’s method and evaluated the resulting Newton basins. We also explored the different applications and limitations of Newton’s method.
